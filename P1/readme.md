As a Data Scientist, for building an intelligent agent that can understand the context of social media posts and as the requirements of Business team the intelligent agent can perform tasks like content segmentation, popularity analysis, and trend detection requires a multi-modal approach to handle different types of data such as text, images, and videos. Here is a generic approach I would consider:
# Dataset Collection:
1.	I will collect a diverse and representative dataset of social media posts from various platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, News Portal).
2.	I will ensure that the dataset contains a mixture of text, image, and video posts, covering different topics and genres.
3.	I will annotate the dataset with relevant labels for tasks such as content segmentation, popularity, and trends. This may involve manual annotation or leveraging existing datasets with similar annotations.
# Preprocessing:
As I have to work with multiple form of data, the data preprocessing task have to perform individually. Because the information extraction doesnâ€™t work similarly for all form of data.
1.	Text Preprocessing: I will perform standard text preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization. Consider specific preprocessing steps based on the characteristics of social media text, such as handling hashtags, mentions, emoticons, and URLs.
2.	Image and Video Preprocessing: For Image and Video data I will extract visual features from images and videos using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet). I will convert videos into a sequence of frames and extract features from each frame. Additionally, will resize and normalize the images and videos.
# Multi-Modal Fusion:
1.	There are a lot of Language Model is available now a days. I can design a Language Model that can understand the data and give information related to these data. Large Language Model including LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, GPT are widely popular now. 
2.	Thinking about multi modal agent, I will combine the textual features with the visual features obtained from images and videos. 
# Model Training:
1.	I will design a multi-modal architecture that can handle the fused data. This could involve using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based models like BERT or GPT to process the text data, and convolutional or recurrent models for the visual data.
2.	I will train the model using the annotated dataset. Utilize appropriate loss functions and evaluation metrics for each task.
3.	I will regularize the model with techniques like dropout, batch normalization, or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Will perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
# Evaluation and Deployment:
1.	I will Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation/test set using appropriate metrics for each task. This could involve measuring accuracy, F1-score, mean average precision, or other task-specific metrics.
2.	I will tune the model based on the evaluation results, adjusting hyperparameters or modifying the architecture as needed.
3.	If the performance of the model is satisfied, I will deploy the intelligent agent as an API or service that can process social media posts and provide insights like content segmentation, popularity analysis, and trend detection in real-time.
